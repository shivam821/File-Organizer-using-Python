# File-Organizer-using-Python
This script takes a directory path as input from the user. It then iterates through all the files in the specified directory. For each file, it extracts the file extension and checks if a directory with that extension already exists. If it does, the file is moved to that directory. If not, a new directory is created with the extension name, and the file is moved into it.
